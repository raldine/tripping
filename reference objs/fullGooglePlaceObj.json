To our surprise, the staff offered us a room to check in immediately! This thoughtful gesture made a huge difference, allowing us to rest after a long journey.\n\nThe staff was incredibly kind and accommodating, making us feel welcome right from the start. The hotel itself is beautiful, clean, and well-maintained. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a comfortable stay with outstanding service.

Only one English speaking channel on the TV.\n\nStaff very unhelpful upon check in where you have to use the kiosk and do everything yourself. Why keep the staff then?\nSome guidance would be appreciated if you arrive late after a 10hr flight. Zero comments about breakfast area, check out times and hotel facilities. They just give you a leaflet in silence.\n\nNow onto food: absolutely the worst. All dishes were cold - not sure if their heating system is faulty or what, but most food was inedible. Best if you skip breakfast and just go to 7eleven downstairs, so much better value for money.\n\nThe location is amazing though with plenty of great quality restaurants within a walking distance. Metro is also a few min walk away.",

The staff wasn’t friendly and every time we asked a question at concierge they seemed irritated. The price of our room didn’t include any cleaning, which we were not informed and it wasn’t made clear when booking. Anything like cleaning service, water, or towels was an extra cost here and should be basic included amenities when staying at a hotel. Lobby isn’t very nice to relax in or have a drink anywhere. Our room was also dirty when we arrived and I had to wipe down all the surfaces and ensure not to touch the outer bedding. Photos attached were right when we arrived into our room and there was greasy film and marks along with discolored bedding. This was closer to the offering of a hostel (which would have been cooler most likely)",

The hotel has a lot of helpful facilities like the shuttle bus, onsen baths, kids play room, on site laundry, vending machines, microwave etc\nI would highly recommend booking an executive room for use of the lounge for 3pm afternoon tea and evening cocktails.\nThe staff are so accommodating and nothing was too difficult.\nBreakfast options aren’t as many as some other breakfast buffets in other hotels but it compliments itself very well and everything is well set out.",

View wasn't good, we got the back of the hotel.\n\nFancy bottled water was included. The lobby was posh. There was room service with western food choices. The bed was comfy. For the price, it can't be beat.\n\nIf it wasn't so far from Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, would've just booked this hotel all 5 nights and just take train every morning to different locations...",

He made the check-in process a breeze with his positive and vibrant demeanour. We stayed on the club floor with Accor platinum benefits. The lounge food was alright but not great, otherwise everything was good. The laundry and public space near the onsen can get crowded at night. Breakfast had a wide and delicious spread, lots of food options. Parking is chargeable.",

The service and hospitality were truly exceptional. Every staff member—from the front desk team to the waitstaff and even the general manager—went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and at home.\n\nOur room was absolutely amazing, and we greatly appreciated the prompt attention to our needs, including the provision of a firmer pillow to ensure our comfort.\n\nIf only we could have extended our stay beyond the five wonderful nights we had! We are already looking forward to our next visit and can wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone seeking an amazing getaway.\n\nA big thanks to everyone we met ❤️!",

Member recognition was good, with an upgraded room and free breakfast. But despite notifying the hotel about my wedding anniversary, there were no special gestures. A little more personal touch would have made the experience even better.",
